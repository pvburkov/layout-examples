# layout-examples
My training layouts (experiments with pure HTML and CSS)

Every single layout would be placed into separate branch.

1. Layout for travel blog (branch ```travel-blog-layout```)
- taken from free UI kit for Adobe XD - https://xdkit.ru/freebie-adobe-xd-resources/freebie-responsive-resize-kit-for-adobe-xd/ (exact screen in Adobe XD online: https://xd.adobe.com/view/7e26ca01-5772-4853-af24-b341f5802849-2b75/specs/)
- design is not responsible at the current moment (made for wide screens)
